			<h1>Theater Costuming for the Beginner</h1>
				<p> Costuming is not like sewing a personal project you don't 
		have time to invest into one project. You will need to have some time 
		to get things planned and executed before a performance. 
		Which is usually about 6 weeks.
				</p>
			<h2> Ideas for costumes</h2>
			
				<p> Ideas for a costume piece are knowing what you want something to look like 
		and using other clothing items to make them look like your idea, 
		a simple dress can be changed to fit any time period. Mens slacks can be changed 
		as well.
				</p>

			<summary> In conclusion this is such a fun field to work. 
			It is very satisfying to watch a character come together 
			with the visual aid that costumes provide.</summary>
